INDEPENDENCE OF GP SERVICES
All GP services must be publishable and runnable in ESRI online environment independently.
This means:
	> GP services cannot call on scripts outside of the GP folder
	> Even scripts that are used in multiple GP services must
	  be copied and pasted into each GP service folder


POTENTIAL PROCESS FOR UPDATED SHARED SCRIPTS:
1. Place the script into the "sharemodules" folder
2. Have a script tool  that loops through all GP service folders and automatically
	does find/replace with the updated version of the script.
	***CAREFUL WHEN DOING THIS--MAKE SURE THERE ARE NOT SUBREPORT-SPECIFIC SCRIPTS WITHIN EACH GP SERVICE FOLDER

# Complete Streets Regional Batch Tool

## Purpose

This tool calculates the PPA Complete Streets Index (CSI) for all road segments provided in a shapefile or feature class of road segments (e.g., SACOG's regional centerline file). With a CSI value for all road segments, PPA3 will be able to normalize each project's CSI on a 0-1 or 0-100 scale based on how the project's CSI compares to the highest CSI in the region or in the project's community type.
